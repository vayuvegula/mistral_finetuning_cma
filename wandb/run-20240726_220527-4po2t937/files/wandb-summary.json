{"filename": "prompt_1.txt", "prompt": "The megacap tech stocks that have driven the market all year are officially sputtering. Since the second week of July, the Magnificent Seven stocks\u2014from Amazon.com to Tesla\u2014have lost altitude like fuel-spent rockets.\nAnd this past week was worse. Alphabet reported slower revenue growth in its YouTube business. Lower electric-vehicle prices and deliveries crimped Tesla earnings. The Mag 7 trajectory turned lower still.\nOne explanation for the downturn has been an investor rotation from Big Tech to small-caps. The tech-led Nasdaq Composite began sinking in relation to the Russell 2000 index around July 10. Analysts across Wall Street seized on the Russell\u2019s breakout to dust off neglected small-cap names.\nBut no single factor explains market trends, and those little Russell stocks can\u2019t absorb all the megacap money. The diverging fortunes of the two indexes only retraces a few months of the Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance of the Russell and the S&P 500 this year.\nAnother explanation for the sentiment shift is that investors now fear spending on artificial intelligence is about to slow.\nBig Tech has wowed the world with new generative-AI platforms. For most tech companies, that\u2019s meant huge spending on AI chips. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary, as the primary vendor of those chips. Everyone has been cheering as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft spend tens of billions of dollars apiece on AI data centers.\nThe gen-AI models can write computer code and compose songs. One thing they haven\u2019t yet done is generate a lot of revenue for anyone other than Nvidia and a few other hardware vendors.\nIt\u2019s entirely fair to ask what returns investors can expect from those billions in capital expenditures. Back in May, I raised that question and found no clear answers.\nWhen I queried the AI models themselves, they forebodingly mentioned workforce reductions as the first outcome.\nAs a journalist, I\u2019m loath to take credit for ideas. Others have also wondered about the return on investing in AI. In June, David Cahn, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, updated an influential analysis he first put out last year, in which he figures that Nvidia\u2019s customers will need to add $600 billion in AI revenue to get an acceptable payback on their investments. As of now, he thinks they\u2019ll be lucky to collectively get $100 billion in new revenue.\nCahn agrees that AI will transform the economy, as the internet and the railroads once did. And Sequoia has backed AI start-ups. But Cahn adds that many speculators in those previous technologies got torched when initial valuations crashed\u2014to the benefit of everyone subsequently using rail or internet service.\nAs Meta stock was faltering two weeks ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak also considered what returns on invested capital the Facebook parent might expect from the $45 billion it plans to invest in capex this year and again in 2025. Concluding that AI will drive higher engagement at Facebook and Instagram, Nowak stuck with his Buy recommendation for Meta.\nThe point of this column isn\u2019t to say that the Mag 7 selloff represents a better pricing of the returns the companies will get from their AI investments. No one can put a fine point on that forecast, any more than early investors could predict how cities would develop along rail lines or how social media would emerge from the internet.\nI\u2019m actually making the opposite argument. If anyone sold stocks in the belief that AI investment will slow, they haven\u2019t been listening to the people doing the spending. Big Tech companies will continue to buy AI hardware from Nvidia and the other vendors.\nWhen Alphabet\u2019s June-quarter report this past week showed that capital spending had nearly doubled from the year-ago period, CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company had to invest aggressively up front in AI, which promises to transform all of the company\u2019s core businesses\u2014from search to YouTube to cloud computing.\n\u201cWhen you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,\u201d he said.\nIt isn\u2019t just internet firms. Moderna co-founder Noubar Afeyan recently told me about plans by his biotech venture firm Flagship Pioneering to spend some of the billions it recently raised on AI models for drug discovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you sit there and let somebody else figure out if it works? No.\u201d\nNo one can predict the winners of the AI sweepstakes in the long run, but in the near term you had better believe the money will keep flowing.", "response": "As Charlie Munger, I'd approach the given text with a lens of multidisciplinary thinking, considering various factors at play and maintaining a focus on long-term outcomes. Here are some observations:\n\n1. **Market Rotations and Sentiment Shifts**: The recent downturn in megacap tech stocks, the Mag 7, appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including investor rotation into small-caps and shifting sentiments about future growth prospects. It's crucial to remember that market rotations are regular occurrences, and short-term sentiment shifts can create opportunities for long-term investors.\n\n2. **AI Investment and Uncertain Returns**: The feverish investment in AI, particularly by Big Tech, is reminiscent of the railroad and internet booms. While the potential is transformative, the returns on these investments are uncertain. As Sequoia Capital's David Cahn pointed out, the initial investors often overestimate short-term gains. It's wise to be cautious and patient here.\n\n3. **The Inversion Principle**: Consider the problem in reverse, as I often advise. What if these companies don't invest heavily in AI and a competitor does? They risk falling behind, as Alphabet's Sundar Pichai implied. So, while returns are uncertain, the alternative could be worse.\n\n4. **Second-Level Thinking**: Everyone knows that AI is a significant opportunity, but what's less obvious is who the ultimate winners will be. It might not be the first movers or even the companies with the deepest pockets. It could be those who find unique applications or business models, like Moderna exploring AI for drug discovery.\n\n5. **The Lollapalooza Effect**: Multiple factors are at play here, creating a complex dynamic. It's not just about AI; it's also about market sentiment, competitive pressures, regulatory environments, and more. These factors interact and reinforce each other, making the situation even more unpredictable.\n\n6. **Long-Term Perspective**: While AI's short-term returns are uncertain, its long-term impact could be profound. As investors, we should be prepared for a long journey with many ups and downs. Remember, it took decades for the railroad and internet revolutions to fully play out.\n\nIn conclusion, while the recent tech stock downturn and AI investment frenzy present many uncertainties, they also create opportunities for patient, long-term investors who are willing to ride out the market's fluctuations and keep learning along the way. After all, as I often say, \"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.\"", "model": "mistral-large-latest", "date": "2024-07-26 22:06:22", "_timestamp": 1722056782.904943, "_runtime": 55.54382610321045, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 54}}
