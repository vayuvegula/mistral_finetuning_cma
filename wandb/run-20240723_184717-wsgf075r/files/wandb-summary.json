This phenomenon, known as the endowment effect, leads individuals to value their own possessions more highly than their potential market value. The implications of this cognitive bias result in skewed decision-making, inclining people towards irrational optimism and poor judgment, particularly in subjective evaluations. This tendency to misappraise oneself can manifest in various domains, including driving skills and parental evaluations, which ultimately contributes to broader societal dysfunctions when individuals make poor choices based on inflated self-perception.", "response_time": 19.558015823364258, "tokens_used": 14578, "_timestamp": 1721785658.588896, "_runtime": 20.780614137649536, "_step": 1, "total_questions_generated": 8, "total_tokens_used": 14578, "output_file": "output_openai_gpt-4o-mini_PoorCharliesAlmanack_chptr_4_talk_11_2.txt_20240723_184738.jsonl", "_wandb": {"runtime": 20}}
