He discusses the narrowness of elite education and proposes solutions to broaden the horizons of professionals such as attorneys."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the two subconscious mental tendencies that Munger identifies as causing trouble in professionals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger identifies two subconscious mental tendencies that cause trouble in professionals: 1) incentive-caused bias, which is a natural cognitive drift toward concluding that what's good for the professional is good for the client and wider civilization, and 2) man-with-a-hammer tendency, where to a man with only a hammer, every problem tends to look like a nail."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger suggest combating the man-with-a-hammer tendency?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that one partial cure for the man-with-a-hammer tendency is to develop a vast set of skills over multiple disciplines. This way, a person carries multiple tools and can limit bad cognitive effects from the tendency. Additionally, being aware of these tendencies and actively fighting against their bad effects both within oneself and from others is a constructive step towards worldly wisdom."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger say about the state of education when he was a student?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger states that the education they received was far too unidisciplinary. He criticizes the approach as being like playing a bridge hand by counting trumps while ignoring all else, calling it 'bonkers, sort of like the Mad Hatter's tea party.' He notes that this unidisciplinary approach was encouraged in isolated departments of soft science."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who does Munger cite as sounding an alarm about the 'fatal unconnectedness of academic disciplines'?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger cites Alfred North Whitehead as sounding an alarm about the 'fatal unconnectedness of academic disciplines' long ago."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What model does Munger suggest looking at for successful narrow-scale education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests looking at the hugely successful education that is mandatory for pilots as a model for successful narrow-scale education. He states that this is where incentives for effective education are strongest and results are most closely measured."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What are the six elements of the pilot training system that Munger outlines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger outlines six elements of the pilot training system: 1) wide formal education covering practically everything useful in piloting, 2) knowledge raised to practice-based fluency, 3) training in both forward and reverse thinking, 4) training time allocated to minimize damage from later malfunctions, 5) mandatory checklist routines, and 6) regular use of aircraft simulators to prevent skill atrophy."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "According to Munger, what makes the task of broadscale multidisciplinary education seem less daunting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger identifies three factors that make the task less daunting: 1) the truly big ideas in each discipline, learned only in essence, carry most of the freight and are not so numerous, 2) in elite education, there is available talent and time (13 years to turn promising 12-year-olds into starting professionals), and 3) thinking by inversion and thorough use of checklists is easily learned."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What example does Munger give of successful multidisciplinary individuals?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger refers to modern Ben Franklins who have achieved a massive multidisciplinary synthesis with less time in formal education than is now available, and have become better performers in their own disciplines despite diverting learning time to matter outside their normal discipline coverage."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger describe the progress in elite soft-science education towards multidisciplinarity since his time as a student?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger states that while many things have been tried as corrections towards better multidisciplinarity and there has been some considerable improvement, much desirable correction is still undone and lies far ahead. He notes that there has been improvement, net, after allowing for some counterproductive results."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What practice does Munger say has usually worked best in correcting unidisciplinary folly?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger says that augmentation, or a 'take what you wish' practice that encourages any discipline to simply assimilate whatever it chooses from other disciplines, has usually worked best in correcting unidisciplinary folly."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What example does Munger give of a successful multidisciplinary approach in law schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger gives the example of law schools bringing in negotiation, drawing on other disciplines, led by his classmate Roger Fisher. He notes that over 3 million copies of Fisher's wise and ethical negotiation book have been sold, possibly making it the best achievement from their whole class."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What criticisms does Munger have of the 'take what you wish' practice in soft science?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger criticizes the 'take what you wish' practice for sometimes leading to undesirable outcomes, such as the assimilation of Freudianism in some literature departments and the importation of extremist political ideologies. He also notes that takings from more fundamental disciplines were often done without attribution, sometimes under new names, with little attention given to rank in a fundamentalness order for absorbed concepts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger suggest as the first practice to hasten progress toward optimized disciplinarity in elite soft science?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that many more courses should be mandatory, not optional. He states that this requires the people who decide what is mandatory to possess large, multidisciplinary knowledge maintained in fluency. He gives the example that both psychology mastery and accounting mastery should be required as outcomes in legal education."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What kind of problem-solving practice does Munger advocate for in multidisciplinary education?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger advocates for much more problem-solving practice that crosses several disciplines, including practice that mimics the function of the aircraft simulator in preventing loss of skills through disuse. He gives an example of a Harvard Business School professor's test involving two old ladies inheriting a shoe factory, where the winning answer relied on fundamental concepts from psychology and economics rather than recent business school teachings."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger suggest about the use of business periodicals in soft-science professional schools?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that most soft-science professional schools should increase their use of the best business periodicals like The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Fortune, etc. He states that these periodicals are quite good and perform the function of the aircraft simulator if used to prompt practice in relating events to multidisciplinary causes."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger say about professors and students with strong political ideologies in academia?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that in filling scarce academic vacancies, professors of super-strong, passionate political ideology, whether on the left or right, should usually be avoided. He extends this to students as well, arguing that best-form multidisciplinarity requires an objectivity that such passionate people have lost."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger suggest soft science should imitate more intensely?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that soft science should more intensely imitate the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science, defined as the fundamental four-discipline combination of math, physics, chemistry, and engineering. He argues that this ethos deserves more imitation due to its success in avoiding unidisciplinary folly and making user-friendly a big patch of multidisciplinary domain."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger describe the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger describes the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science as: ranking and using disciplines in order of fundamentalness, mastering and routinely using the essential parts of all four constituents of the fundamental four-discipline combination, avoiding cross-disciplinary absorption without attribution, adhering to a principle of economy in explanations, and only establishing new principles through rigorous testing and without contradicting established principles unless proven false."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger compare the ethos of hard science to current practices in soft science?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger states that compared to much current practice in soft science, the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science is more severe. He likens it to pilot training, saying it doesn't say 'Take what you wish' but 'Learn it all to fluency, like it or not.' He also notes that it forces rational organization of multidisciplinary knowledge through mandatory full attribution for cross-disciplinary takings and preference for the most fundamental explanation."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What personal example does Munger give to demonstrate the value of taking the fundamental organizing ethos seriously?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger offers the example of his own life. He describes coming to Harvard Law School poorly educated with no college degree, but having assimilated the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science from elementary physics and math. He used this as an organizing guide and filing system in his search for multidisciplinary worldly wisdom, which he says enhanced his ability to serve everything he loved far beyond his deserts."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "According to Munger, what is most interesting about his answers to his own questions?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger finds it most interesting that while everything he has said is non-original and has long been obvious to many sound and well-educated minds, all the evils he decries remain grossly over-present in the best soft-science educational domains. He sees this as implying that soft-science departments tolerate perverse incentives."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger suggest is the cause of the persistence of unidisciplinary wrongheadedness in soft-science domains?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that wrong incentives are a major cause of the persistence of unidisciplinary wrongheadedness in soft-science domains. He cites Dr. Samuel Johnson's observation that truth is hard to assimilate in any mind when opposed by interest. Munger argues that if institutional incentives cause the problem, then a remedy is feasible because incentives can be changed."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What term does Munger use, quoting Dr. Johnson, to describe the maintenance of removable academic ignorance?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger, quoting Dr. Johnson, uses the term 'treachery' to describe the maintenance of academic ignorance that is removable through diligence."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What rewards does Munger predict for adopting a more multidisciplinary approach?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger predicts immense worldly rewards for law schools and other academic domains in adopting a more multidisciplinary approach to many problems. He also suggests there will be more fun and accomplishment, describing the mental realm he recommends as one from which no one willingly returns, likening a return to cutting off one's hands."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger describe his attitude towards his ideas in the 2006 revisit of the talk?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the 2006 revisit, Munger states that he would not change a word of the talk and continues to believe that his ideas are important. He acknowledges that in this attitude, he may be displaying too much similarity to his long-dead relative, Reverend Theodore Munger, who published his sermons with a strong, ex cathedra tone and made no changes in later editions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What example does Munger give of a successful extension of the hard science ethos into softer disciplines?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger gives the example of biology, which started 150 years ago as a descriptive mess not much related to deep theory, but has gradually absorbed the fundamental organizing ethos of hard science with marvelous results. He notes that new generations in biology have come to use better thinking methods containing models that answer the question 'Why?'"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does Munger describe the potential for extending the ethos of hard science to disciplines far less fundamental than biology?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger states that there is no clear reason why the ethos of hard science can't also help in disciplines far less fundamental than biology. He suggests that this ethos can be extended into softer fare, as it has worked well in previous extensions."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger say about the relationship between duty and advantage in improving academic approaches?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger suggests that if duty will not move improvement, advantage is also available. He argues that there will be immense worldly rewards, as well as more fun and accomplishment, for academic domains that adopt a more multidisciplinary approach to problems."}]}
