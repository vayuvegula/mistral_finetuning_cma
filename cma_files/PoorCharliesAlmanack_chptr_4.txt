Chapter 4 stripe.press/pca-4 Eleven Talks Charlie Munger is not the least bit shy when it comes to offering both frank criticism and constructive advice. When he sets his sights on an issue—be it a corrupt business practice, an academic failing, or a financial scandal—he lets loose with both barrels. Which is not to say he spends all his time focused on life’s failings. He is equally at home discussing the values of lifelong learning or the joys of a successful marriage. But whatever the topic, Charlie is apt to tell it like it is, which is exactly what he has done in over two decades of public speaking. Here, then, are 11 of Charlie’s best talks, including a special compilation he has prepared exclusively for this book. Enjoy.
