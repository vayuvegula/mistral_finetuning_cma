And the great useful model, after compound interest, is the elementary math of permutations and combinations.' He emphasizes that this knowledge should be used routinely in daily life for effective decision-making."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger say about the limitations of accounting?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger acknowledges that accounting is crucial but has limitations. He says, 'It's the language of practical business life. It was a very useful thing to deliver to civilization. I've heard it came to civilization through Venice, which, of course, was once the great commercial power in the Mediterranean. However, double-entry bookkeeping was a hell of an invention. And it's not that hard to understand. But you have to know enough about it to understand its limitations\u2014because although accounting is the starting place, it's only a crude approximation.'"}]}

He says, 'Now we come to another, somewhat less reliable form of human wisdom: microeconomics.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What does Munger say about the disadvantages of scale in business?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Munger points out that scale can also lead to disadvantages, particularly in the form of bureaucracy. He explains, 'The great defect of scale, of course, which makes the game interesting\u2014so that the big people don't always win\u2014is that as you get big, you get the bureaucracy. And with the bureaucracy comes the territoriality\u2014which is again grounded in human nature.' He notes that this can lead to slow decision-making and inefficiencies."}]}

He says, 'When a surfer gets up and catches the wave and just stays there, he can go a long, long time. But if he gets off the wave, he becomes mired in shallows.'

I see terrible mistakes from people being overly motivated by tax considerations.' He emphasizes the importance of long-term holding and compounding returns, even if it means paying taxes, rather than engaging in complex tax-avoidance schemes."}]}

He says, 'I don't mean to say that he's only had 10 insights. I'm just saying that most of the money came from 10 insights.'
