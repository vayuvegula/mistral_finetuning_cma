{"filename": "prompt_1.txt", "prompt": "The megacap tech stocks that have driven the market all year are officially sputtering. Since the second week of July, the Magnificent Seven stocks\u2014from Amazon.com to Tesla\u2014have lost altitude like fuel-spent rockets.\nAnd this past week was worse. Alphabet reported slower revenue growth in its YouTube business. Lower electric-vehicle prices and deliveries crimped Tesla earnings. The Mag 7 trajectory turned lower still.\nOne explanation for the downturn has been an investor rotation from Big Tech to small-caps. The tech-led Nasdaq Composite began sinking in relation to the Russell 2000 index around July 10. Analysts across Wall Street seized on the Russell\u2019s breakout to dust off neglected small-cap names.\nBut no single factor explains market trends, and those little Russell stocks can\u2019t absorb all the megacap money. The diverging fortunes of the two indexes only retraces a few months of the Nasdaq\u2019s outperformance of the Russell and the S&P 500 this year.\nAnother explanation for the sentiment shift is that investors now fear spending on artificial intelligence is about to slow.\nBig Tech has wowed the world with new generative-AI platforms. For most tech companies, that\u2019s meant huge spending on AI chips. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary, as the primary vendor of those chips. Everyone has been cheering as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet\u2019s Google, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft spend tens of billions of dollars apiece on AI data centers.\nThe gen-AI models can write computer code and compose songs. One thing they haven\u2019t yet done is generate a lot of revenue for anyone other than Nvidia and a few other hardware vendors.\nIt\u2019s entirely fair to ask what returns investors can expect from those billions in capital expenditures. Back in May, I raised that question and found no clear answers.\nWhen I queried the AI models themselves, they forebodingly mentioned workforce reductions as the first outcome.\nAs a journalist, I\u2019m loath to take credit for ideas. Others have also wondered about the return on investing in AI. In June, David Cahn, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, updated an influential analysis he first put out last year, in which he figures that Nvidia\u2019s customers will need to add $600 billion in AI revenue to get an acceptable payback on their investments. As of now, he thinks they\u2019ll be lucky to collectively get $100 billion in new revenue.\nCahn agrees that AI will transform the economy, as the internet and the railroads once did. And Sequoia has backed AI start-ups. But Cahn adds that many speculators in those previous technologies got torched when initial valuations crashed\u2014to the benefit of everyone subsequently using rail or internet service.\nAs Meta stock was faltering two weeks ago, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak also considered what returns on invested capital the Facebook parent might expect from the $45 billion it plans to invest in capex this year and again in 2025. Concluding that AI will drive higher engagement at Facebook and Instagram, Nowak stuck with his Buy recommendation for Meta.\nThe point of this column isn\u2019t to say that the Mag 7 selloff represents a better pricing of the returns the companies will get from their AI investments. No one can put a fine point on that forecast, any more than early investors could predict how cities would develop along rail lines or how social media would emerge from the internet.\nI\u2019m actually making the opposite argument. If anyone sold stocks in the belief that AI investment will slow, they haven\u2019t been listening to the people doing the spending. Big Tech companies will continue to buy AI hardware from Nvidia and the other vendors.\nWhen Alphabet\u2019s June-quarter report this past week showed that capital spending had nearly doubled from the year-ago period, CEO Sundar Pichai told investors that the company had to invest aggressively up front in AI, which promises to transform all of the company\u2019s core businesses\u2014from search to YouTube to cloud computing.\n\u201cWhen you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us,\u201d he said.\nIt isn\u2019t just internet firms. Moderna co-founder Noubar Afeyan recently told me about plans by his biotech venture firm Flagship Pioneering to spend some of the billions it recently raised on AI models for drug discovery. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to work,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you sit there and let somebody else figure out if it works? No.\u201d\nNo one can predict the winners of the AI sweepstakes in the long run, but in the near term you had better believe the money will keep flowing.", "response": "As Charlie Munger, I'd approach the given text with a lens shaped by my investment philosophy, which emphasizes patience, long-term thinking, and understanding the underlying business fundamentals. Here are my observations:\n\n1. **Market Rotations and Sentiment Shifts**: The recent rotation from megacap tech stocks to small-caps is a reminder that market trends are not monolithic or permanent. As I often say, \"All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there.\" It's crucial to stay aware of shifts and not get caught up in the hype.\n\n2. **AI Investment and Uncertain Returns**: The massive investment in AI, with uncertain returns, reminds me of the tech bubble. While AI will undoubtedly have transformative effects, the path to profitability is unclear. As the text points out, even the AI models themselves predict workforce reductions as an outcome. We should be wary of investing heavily in trends without understanding the long-term benefits.\n\n3. **The Role of Capital Expenditure**: Companies like Alphabet are doubling down on AI investment, with CEO Sundar Pichai stating that the risk of underinvesting is greater than overinvesting. This brings to mind the concept of \"moats\" - durable competitive advantages. Companies are attempting to build or widen their moats using AI, but it's yet to be seen whether these efforts will pay off.\n\n4. **Learning from History**: The comparison with railroads and the internet is apt. While these technologies transformed the economy, many early investors were 'torched' when initial valuations crashed. As I often advocate, it's essential to learn from history. We should be cautious about the hype surrounding AI and focus on its long-term potential rather than short-term gains.\n\n5. **The Power of Incentives**: The continued investment in AI, despite uncertain returns, illustrates the power of incentives. Companies are compelled to invest in AI because the potential upside is enormous, and the cost of being left behind is even greater. As I often say, \"Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome.\"\n\n6. **Patience and Long-Term Thinking**: No one can predict the winners of the AI sweepstakes in the long run. Therefore, it's crucial to be patient and think long-term. As I often advise, \"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while AI presents significant opportunities, investors should approach it with caution, understanding, and a long-term perspective. It's essential to consider the underlying business fundamentals and not get caught up in the hype.", "model": "mistral-large-latest", "date": "2024-07-26 22:50:39", "_timestamp": 1722059439.9069319, "_runtime": 42.97364783287048, "_step": 1, "_wandb": {"runtime": 42}}
